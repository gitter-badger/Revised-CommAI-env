#### Setting a new standard for a stable, containerised, development, testing,  and evaluation environment
#### for Machine Learning and AI researchers and developers. GNU 3.0+ Licensed

    - Status: Under Development
    - First Beta Testing Release Target: June 2017
    - Vesion 1.0 Release Target: Sept 2017

The facebookresearch Team began the implementation of the CommAI-env in summer of 2016. Their work to date has provided
 me with an entry point into the ongoing development of the concepts detailed by Marco Baroni et al. in their paper
 CommAI-env. The abstract is available in /docs/CommAI_PDF_1701.08954.pdf.

After a line-by-line examination of the facebookresearch implementation, I was inspired by the possibilities a fresh
 perspective could bring to the table, and ultimately contribute to the existing body of work.

The approach I propose to further the development of the source code and documentation are a radical departure from
the conventions I've observed in my limited reviews of existing development work-flows and wfm (workforce management)
strategies.

I will be documenting my techniques, tools, and strategies during the process from idea to release 1.0 in the hope
the information will be of use to the community at large to 'cherry pick' any material relevant to their requirements,
work style, and working environment. Or simply as another data point in their set.

The GNU 3.0+ style LICENSE is the most well suited to my objectives. In essence it grants everyone permission to use
the intellectual property contained in this body (* outside of the actual facebookresearch source code which is
governed by the CommAI-env_software_LICENSE.txt in the root directory). Without charge, forever.

In addition the GNU license makes this work available without imposing concerns for users or contributors of future
Licensing or Patent enforcement by third parties and opens doors to people bound by other agreements.

#### On the environment, CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI
Marco Baroni, Armand Joulin, Allan Jabri, Germ√†n Kruszewski, Angeliki Lazaridou, Klemen Simonic, Tomas Mikolov

_With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking
like an attainable goal. However, most current research focuses instead on important but narrow applications,
such as image classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective
ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of
concrete desiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such
desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a minimum._

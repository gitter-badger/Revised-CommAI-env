The facebookresearch Team began the implementation of the CommAI-env as detailed by Marco Baroni et al. The abstract
is available in /docs/CommAI_PDF_1701.08954.pdf.

After a line-by-line examination of the facebookresearch repository, I determined an refactor of the currently
CommAI-env implementation was required from the ground up, rebuilding it in pure Python >=3.5.

### On the environment, CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI
Marco Baroni, Armand Joulin, Allan Jabri, Germ√†n Kruszewski, Angeliki Lazaridou, Klemen Simonic, Tomas Mikolov

_With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking
like an attainable goal. However, most current research focuses instead on important but narrow applications,
such as image classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective
ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of
concrete desiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such
desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a minimum._

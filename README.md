## Revised-CommAI-env Pre-Release Ver. 0.2

#### Setting a new standard for a stable, containerised, development, testing,  and evaluation environment
#### for Machine Learning and AI researchers and developers. GNU 3.0+ Licensed

    - Status: Under Development
    - First Beta Testing Release Target: June 2017
    - Vesion 1.0 Release Target: Sept 2017

## Prelude

I began work on the implementation of the CommAI-env based on the release incorporated within the code provided in a
commercial AI contest. After some initial exploration and refactoring, I confirmed my theory it would more efficient
to fork farther upstream. On April 15th I set aside my work to date, and initiated this repository as
a refactor of the Github facebookreseacrh/CommAI-env Beta-Test release.

## WHY NOW?

The kick-start that spurred me to make all of my development public, with the consequence's of making the proto version
subject to open examination was entirely do to #### Nat Friedman's AIGrant: Get $5,000 for your open source AI project:
https://nat.org/aigrant-get-5-000-for-your-open-source-ai-project-1118dd7db083

I subscribe to Nat' feed via Medium: https://medium.com Nat is one a number of writers who's work publishes on Medium
which I there make time to read when I see a new post.

## Week One Progress Report

I'm very excited both at the rapid pace of development as both the Project Lead, and as the sole contributor to the
effort. I hit the ground running to speed the process of refactoring my code and docstrings to a level where more than
one contributor can check out files.

#### Completed
All Python source files have been refactored into Python style pseudo code, and tagged with notations where
conversions are required to use the code blocks individually as functional code. Initial work

#### WIP [Work in Progress]

Everything else. One of the core of elements of my development process is: _Don't spend time preparing for description of future work when
completing the work itself is possible within the given constraints._

#### METRICS

As the initial week has no baseline to provide metrics, first metrics reports will be provided on May 5, 2017.

#### RAW INFORMATION

Raw reports of lines added & deleted, commits, and other activity can be viewed via the Pulse and other other tabs at

### CoomAI-env Background

The facebookresearch Team began the implementation of the CommAI-env in summer of 2016. Their work to date has provided
 me with an entry point into the ongoing development of the concepts detailed by Marco Baroni et al. in their paper
 CommAI-env. The abstract is available in /docs/CommAI_PDF_1701.08954.pdf.

### Revsied CommAI-env History

After a line-by-line examination of the facebookresearch implementation, I was inspired by the possibilities a fresh
 perspective could bring to the table, and ultimately contribute to the existing body of work.

The approach I propose to further the development of the source code and documentation are a radical departure from
the conventions I've observed in my limited reviews of existing development work-flows and wfm (workforce management)
strategies.

I am still exploring how best to communicate the work flow information.  A few stubs were add to the Github Wiki here.
https://github.com/stephenbhope/Revised-CommAI-env/wiki

I will be documenting my techniques, tools, and strategies during the process from idea to release 1.0 in the hope
the information will be of use to the community at large to 'cherry pick' any material relevant to their requirements,
work style, and working environment. Or simply as another data point in their set.

The GNU 3.0+ style LICENSE is the most well suited to my objectives. In essence it grants everyone permission to use
the intellectual property contained in this body (* outside of the actual facebookresearch source code which is
governed by the CommAI-env_software_LICENSE.txt in the root directory). Without charge, forever.

In addition the GNU license makes this work available without imposing concerns for users or contributors of future
Licensing or Patent enforcement by third parties and opens doors to people bound by other agreements.

#### On the environment, CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI
Marco Baroni, Armand Joulin, Allan Jabri, Germ√†n Kruszewski, Angeliki Lazaridou, Klemen Simonic, Tomas Mikolov

_With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking
like an attainable goal. However, most current research focuses instead on important but narrow applications,
such as image classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective
ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of
concrete desiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such
desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a minimum._

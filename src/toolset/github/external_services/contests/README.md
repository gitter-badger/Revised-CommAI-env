## GoodAI.org, General AI Challenge, Round1

#### Preparation steps

1. Register for the General AI Challenge at https://www.general-ai-challenge.org/active-rounds

ON-HOLD 2. Send an email to Tomas Prokop at b-toprok@microsoft.com and attach a copy of your registration confirmation. He is
the point of contact at Microsoft which is provisioning entrants with access to Azure Cloud Services.

3. If you do not have a **free** Github account register here: https://github.com/

4. (Optional) Visit the contest forum at https://discourse.general-ai-challenge.org/ and introduce yourself. It's early
days in the process so there is little activity to date, traffic is starting to pick up, with collaborations and Teams
assembling.

#### Support and refactoring of the General AI Challenge Round 1, has been dropped due to a lack of participants
The General AI Challenge forums currently indicate a single entrant actively working on a submission.
 The author noted they were not using the General AI Challenge environment for development.  The first round of the
 challenge opened February 14, 2017, and closes in August 2017.

_GoodAI_, and _General AI Challenge_ declined my offer to contribute directly.

Please note they have very unusual practice for reporting, check before posting any issues concerning 'code quality'.

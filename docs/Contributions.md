### Checklist:

- An ongoing commitment to be courteous and show respect to all members of the community irrespective of their
contribution and standing in other communities.

### How to start NOW!

Join a local Meet-Up group of your area of interest. It's a great place to both learn from presenter's. Spend a hour
before the meeting preparing any questions into a specific yes / no reply format.  Want to ask just one question of
collective wisdom and experience's of the leaders of the the field, be respectful of their time.

_To sum up, regardless of the medium, in person, via web front end, telephone, do your research FIRST. Then ask.
If the task is too complex to communicate in a few sentences to a peer, it needs to be reduced further. If you can not
frame the question as a closed question, yes/no, you likely will not understand the experts answer in that application._
